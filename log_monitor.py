"""
Log Monitor Module
==================

This module provides continuous monitoring of log files for exception detection.
It watches for specific keywords that indicate errors, exceptions, or issues
and triggers alerts via email and system tray notifications.

The monitor runs continuously, checking for new log entries and analyzing
them for exception-related keywords. When detected, it immediately sends
alerts to configured recipients.

Features:
- Real-time log file monitoring
- Configurable exception keywords
- Automatic email alerts
- System tray notifications
- Environment-based configuration

    """
    Monitor a log file for exceptions and send alerts.
    
    This function continuously monitors the specified log file for new entries
    containing exception-related keywords. When detected, it triggers:
    1. Email alerts to configured recipients
    2. System tray popup notifications
    
    The function runs indefinitely until interrupted (Ctrl+C) and uses
    efficient file tailing to monitor only new log entries.
    
    Returns:
        None
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the specified log file doesn't exist
        PermissionError: If the log file cannot be read
        KeyboardInterrupt: When user stops the monitoring (Ctrl+C)
